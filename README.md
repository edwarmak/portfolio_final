Hi, I'm Makayla! I am a software engineer, musician, and car enthusiast. Before graduating General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course, I worked as a ski lift operator and car mechanic. Both jobs were demanding of my focus and eye for detail. My love for solving technical problems has brought me to you!

As a classical musician I am passionate about working as a team. After playing cello in a chamber orchestra, I learned that each musician has their own role. In order to be successful, you must demonstrate trust and listen to those around you. This way you can adjust your dynamics to ensure that all instruments, or team members, blend as one.

Excited to connect with you!
